	<h1>Project Redesign</h1>
	<p>The website for the redesign is http://theatredowntown.net/index.html. It is a site for a local theater located in downtown, Orlano. This website needs a more organized look and feel to it. It will also need to have a color palette created for it to keep a consistent color theme throughout the site. Currently, the site looks different on each page. The navigation items are on multiple lines and look very outdated. Throughout this page, I will explain in detail what the redesign will be. </p>

	<h1>Main Goals</h1>
	<p>The main goals of this redesign are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Make the site more user friendly.</li>
		<li>Clean up the site.</li>
		<li>Organize the content.</li>
		<li>Set a consistent pattern between each page.</li>
	</ol>


	<div id="target">
		<h1>Target Audience</h1>
		<p>The main target audience for this site is females, between the ages of 25-34 years old. A large majority of these are graduate school graduates with no children. They also mostly view this site from either school or work. This is important to note, as at work or school they will be pressed for time and need to accomplish things fast.</p>

		<p><strong>Goals:</strong> I like to take my girlfriend out to plays a few times a year. We usually go for ones that we haven't been to before or necessarily heard of. I like to use sites that let me see plays by their date and times. A nice description of the play is also very useful for me as I do not always know all of the plays.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Go to google</li>
			<li>Browse local theaters</li>
			<li>Find one of interest</li>
			<li>Search for random plays</li>
			<li>Read descriptions</li>
			<li>Find dates</li>
			<li>Purchase tickets</li>

	<h1>Validation before Redesign</h1>
	<p>Upon validation http://theatredowntown.net/ there was 44 known errors found within the HTML. This will affect search engine optimization. With the redesign I will make sure there are no errors in the HTML or in the CSS. This will help bump this site up on search engines and give the site more traffic against competitors.</p>

	<div id="competitor">
		<h1>Competitors</h1>
		<h2>http://www.theatermania.com/orlando-theater/</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Rank:</strong> 76,498 Global</li>
			<li><strong>Linking in:</strong> 3,327</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This site is much more professional in appearance. The professional look and feel will make a user feel more safe and comfortable while browsing this site. The nagivation is very easy to follow. The site is consistent between each page. The images are also consistent with layout, sizes and quality. Overall, this site is much cleaner than the site I will be redesigning. My goal is to take some of the same tactics that this theatre site is using and apply them to my client's page, but with improvements.</p>

		<h2>http://www.orlandoshakes.org/index.html</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Rank:</strong> 673,368 Global</li>
			<li><strong>Linking in:</strong> 235</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This site is much like the one above. This site shows a mix of professionalism and a family environment. The feel of this site is very inviting. The content is displayed in nice organized groups. Layout is simple but efficient. Each page stays consistent in design with the others. The navigation is very easy to follow. Lastly, the featured area is very easy to find and read about.</p>
